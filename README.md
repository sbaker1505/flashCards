# Flash Cards App

This app was developed using React Native coupled with Redux.

The goal of this app is to help students be able to study material on the go from their mobile device.

## How to use

Either Clone or Fork this repository and run (in your terminal)

* Install and start the app
    - `yarn install`
    - `yarn start`

You will need either an iOS simulator such as xCode, available from the Apple App Store, or you may download expo from the Apple App Store on your mobile device. Once installed with `yarn install`, you can run the app via `yarn start` and either scan the QR code to view the app on your mobile device or press `i` on your keyboard to open and view from the iOS simulator.

## Tested mobile devices

As of January 1, 2018, this app has been tested on iPhone 8 and iPhone 7.
